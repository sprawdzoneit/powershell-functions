                                                                                                    1074 System has been shutdown by a process/user
                                                                                                    6005 The Event log service was started
                                                                                                    6006 The Event log service was stopped
                                                                                                    6008 The previous system shutdown at time on date was unexpected
                                                                                                    6013 The system uptime is number seconds

                                                                                                    Event ID 1704 documents shut down events. 
                                                                                                    Event IDâ€™s 6006, 6008 and 6013 document events related to a power cycle and may or may not be useful depending on your particular situation. 
                                                                                                    Pairing the 6000 events with 1074 gives a picture of how long restart operations took to complete. 
                                                                                                    6008 is important for recognizing when a computer may have blue screened or lost power unexpectedly. 
                                                                                                    6013 is not related to power cycle events, instead, it documents how long a computer has been running since the last restart.
